# Project Portfolio

[Examining New Age Analytics of European Soccer](https://github.com/benny-zhao/european-football-analytics)

- Compiled hourly meteorological and pollution data in Beijing into 1,800 daily averages spanning from 2010 to 2014
- Modeled air pollution, using PM2.5 concentration, the concentration of particles with diameters < 2.5μm, as the metric to determine the influence of meteorological and temporal variables on the extent of air pollution using R
- Conducted variable selection using Bayesian information criterion to eliminate
insignificant variables from the final model
- Applied transformations to prototype models to correct violations in modeling
assumptions

[Assessing Concrete Compressive Strength in Relation to Age and Composition](https://github.com/benny-zhao/concrete-compressive-strength)

- Performed correlation analysis on concrete composition, compressive strength, and age using SAS
- Produced a statistically significant model for compressive strength using the ratio of various components of concrete to water which explained 72% of the variation in compressive strength
- Evaluated model diagnostics to ensure preliminary statistical assumptions were not violated
